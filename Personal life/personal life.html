     <h1>Personal Life</h1>

     <p>Tesla worked every day from <ins>9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m.</ins> or later, with dinner from exactly 8:10 p.m., 
        at Delmonico's restaurant and later the Waldorf- <br/> Astoria Hotel. Tesla would telephone his dinner 
        order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. "The meal was required to be <br/> ready 
        at eight o'clock ... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would <br/> give a dinner to a group 
        to meet his social obligations. Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3:00 a.m.".
        </p>

     <p>For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 and 10 miles (13 and 16 km) per day. He curled his toes one hundred 
        times for each foot every night, saying that it <br/> stimulated his brain cells.
        </p>

     <p>In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that he did not
        believe in telepathy, stating, "Suppose I made up my mind to murder <br/> you," he said,
        "In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the
        mind get at all this?" In the same interview, Tesla <br/> said that he believed that all 
       fundamental laws could be reduced to one.</p>

     <h1>Eidetic memory </h1>

     <p>Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory.He 
      was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: <br/> Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian,
       Italian, and Latin. Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments <br/> of inspiration. 
      During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which
       blinding flashes of light would <br/> appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions.Often, the visions were
       linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they <br/> would provide the solution to a 
      particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision 
      it in realistic <br/> detail.Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all
       dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a <br/> technique sometimes known as picture thinking. 
      He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, <br/> Tesla had
       frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.</p>

     <h1>Sleep habits </h1>

     <p>Tesla claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night.However, he did admit to "dozing" from time
      to time "to recharge his batteries."  During his <br/> second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed
      a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours 
     in <br/> a stretch at a gaming table. On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours 
     without rest.Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom <br/> Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. 
     Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: "I was sleeping in my room like <br/> one dead ... 
     Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... [Tesla] spoke animatedly, with pauses, [as he] ... work[ed] 
     out a problem, comparing one <br/> theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution,
      he suddenly closed the telephone."</p>
