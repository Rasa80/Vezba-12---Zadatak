<h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>

<p> <strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> (10 July 1856 â€“ 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, <br/> and futurist who 
    is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern <ins>alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</ins> </p>

<p>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained <br/> practical experience
    in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He <br/> emigrated to the United States in 1884, 
    where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison <br/> Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. 
    With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set <br/> up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and
     mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) <br/> induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, 
    earned him a considerable amount of <br/> money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.

<p>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical <br/> oscillators/generators, electrical 
    discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever <br/> exhibited. Tesla became well known as an 
    inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his <br/> lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.
    Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas <br/> for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, 
    high-frequency power experiments in <br/> New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his
     devices. <br/>Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication <br/> and 
    power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.</p>

<p>After Wardenclyffe, Tesla went on to try to develop a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success.  <br/> Having spent most of 
    his money, he lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. Tesla died in New York City  <br/> in January 1943. His work fell into relative
    obscurity following his death, but in 1960, the General Conference on Weights and  <br/> Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his 
    honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla  <br/> since the 1990s</p>
